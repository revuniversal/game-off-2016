# game-off-2016

Making a video game sounds like fun, right?  Well, it's not.  Game dev is hard and the ergonomics tend to be awful.  Chances are that you'd rather be making web apps for the US Army.  If you're still not convinced then talk to your doctor.  If you like pain then maybe you'd like to give a hand.

### Prerequisites:

- [x] make a gitter channel

### Rev's Vague Game Design plan &#8482;

- [ ] prototype ideas with physical analogs (paper, pencil, dice, etc.--think D&D)
- [ ] when a fun idea occurs, start simplifying it, we won't have time to simplify it later.
- [ ] Once the idea is simple, create a proof of concept in code
- [ ] If the concept is viable, proceed, otherwise get back to prototyping
- [ ] Find a game engine
- [ ] Assemble a build pipeline
- [ ] Make the entire game, one "screen" at a time
  - [ ] Make the whole game without thought for speed or polish
  - [ ] Open an issue on GitHub if you find a bug
  - [ ] Play it a little, cut anything that isn't fun.
  - [ ] Play it a little more, fix anything that causes slow down (usually garbage collection)
  - [ ] Play it a little more and start making the most important things prettier
  - [ ] Play it a little more and add essential sound effects
  - [ ] Play it a little more and add appropriate background music
  - [ ] Hope/pray that somebody is working the bug list
  - [ ] Polish, polish, polish until the deadline.
  
Priorities are:

1. Fun
2. Framerate
3. Graphics
4. Sound Effects
5. Music
6. Hygiene
